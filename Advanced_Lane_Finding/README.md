## notebook.ipynb 
The code for completing the project.

## project_video(1).mp4 
Input video for the project.

## challenge_video.mp4 
An optional challenge video. It presents more challenges such as shadow from road barrier that's very close to the left lane, dark region (when car went under the bridge), road with various colors, and lines on the road that are not lane lines. As a result, the code from notebook.ipynb was heavily modified with additional color thresholds and curve fitting methods.

## Challenge.ipynb 
The code I wrote to process the challenge video.
