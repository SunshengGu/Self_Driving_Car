notebook.ipynb is the code for completing the project.
project_video(1).mp4 is input video for the project.
challenge_video.mp4 is an optional challenge video. It presents more challenges such as shadows, road with various colors. As a result, the code from notebook.ipynb was heavily modified with additional color thresholds and curve fitting methods.
Challenge.ipynb is the code I wrote to process the challenge video.
